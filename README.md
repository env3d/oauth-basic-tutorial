# Very basic oauth tutorial

You can see this app in action at https://env3d.github.io/oauth-basic-tutorial

The index.html file is well commented, so you should be able to get all the
informaiton from there.  We will be following the authorization code flow, which
is the standard flow for OAuth.  We will also be using pkce as the standard technology
for single page app (https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/single-page-apps/)

You can host this index.html file under and web server as a static file.

This is implemented without the use of SDK, and follows the steps at
[https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/manually-build-a-login-flow/)

To test this yourself, you will need to:

 1. Create facebook developer account
 1. Create an "App" within the developer account
 1. Pick the "Facebook Login" use case
 1. Fill in all the necessary fields

If you want to make your app public with a "Login with Facebook" button, you will
need to verify your business with Facebook.

# Create Developer Account

Visit [https://developer.facebook.com/](https://developer.facebook.com/) to create a
developer account, the go to the app dashboard and click "Create App".

the user's email.

# Redirect URI

The most important field is the "redirect_uri", which is your app's URL.  This will
allow users to go back to your app after logging in via Facebook.

Click on the "save changes" button.

# App settings

Navigate back to the app page, and this time select "App settings" -> Basic.  Make
note of the "App ID".  You will also need to fill our the various fields such as
"Privacy Policy URL" and "Terms of Service URL".  You can simply use your app's
URL for that.

# Modify you app code

With your own "app id" and "redirect uri", you are now ready to modify your code.  Note
that only you can login to your page as the app is in "Testing" mode.  Facebook now requires
business verification to launch this app to the public.
